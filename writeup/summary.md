# Trader Behavior vs Market Sentiment

## Methodology
We merged trader-level transaction data with daily market sentiment
(Fear & Greed Index). Trades were aggregated at daily level and key
metrics such as PnL, win rate, trade frequency, leverage proxy, and
long/short bias were computed. Sentiment was encoded to analyze its
impact on trader behavior and performance.

## Key Insights
1. Trader performance improves on Greed days, with higher average PnL
   and win rate compared to Fear days.
2. During Fear sentiment, traders reduce position sizes and trade
   frequency, indicating risk-off behavior.
3. High-frequency traders are more sensitive to sentiment shifts than
   infrequent traders.

## Strategy Recommendations
1. During Fear days, traders should reduce leverage and focus on fewer,
   higher-conviction trades.
2. On Greed days, frequent traders can increase activity but must apply
   strict risk controls to avoid overtrading.
